An implementation for understanding data structures


Data Structure

A way of organizing data so it is used the most effectively.

Why are data structures important?

They are the basic ingredients to create algorithms. Very important to manage data. For me, they make the code cleaner. Its the data structures which makes the difference between an okay product to an awesome product.

What is an Abstract Data Type?

It is an absraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not provide the information on how it should be implemented. 

| Abstract Data Type       | Implementation       |
|----------------|----------------|
| List  | Dynamic Array, Linked List  |
| Queue | Linked List Queue, Array based Queue  |
| Map  | Tree map, Hash map  |
