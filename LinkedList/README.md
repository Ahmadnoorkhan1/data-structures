# My Understanding of Linked Lists
An implementation for understanding Linked Lists using javascript.

## Linked Lists
A linked list is a sequenctial list of nodes that holds data which points to other nodes also containing data.

**Where are Linked Lists used?**
Linked lists are used to implement lists, queues, stacks. They are great to use in circular lists. They can easily model the real world objects. They are used in seperate chaining, which is present in certain hashtable implementations to deal with hashing collisions. Often used in the implementation of adjaceny lists for graphs.

### Terminologies in Linked Lists

**Head** : The first node in the linked list.
**Tail** : The last node in the linked list.
**Pointer** : The reference to the node.
**Node** : The object containing data and pointers.
